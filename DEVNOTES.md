# Full-Stack React + Python ML Project Workflow

Follow these steps to build a full-stack project with React frontend, Python backend, and an ML model for quote prediction.

## Step 1: Explore a Minimal ML + React + Flask Workflow
Start with a simple tutorial that integrates a machine learning model with a React frontend using Flask.
- Link: [Integrating a ML Model with React and Flask](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs/integrating-a-ml-model-with-react-and-flask/)

## Step 2: Scaffold Your Project Structure
Use a starter template to organize your frontend and backend directories and basic project structure.
- Link: [React-Flask Template](https://4geeks.com/lesson/react-flask-template)

## Step 3: Choose Your Backend Framework
Decide whether to use Flask or FastAPI. Flask is simpler and widely used; FastAPI is modern, fast, and has automatic API documentation.
- Flask resources: [Flask-React Template](https://github.com/ilfrich/flask-react-template)
- FastAPI resources: [FastAPI Tutorial with React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-farm-stack-fastapi-reactjs-mongodb/)

## Step 4: Build Your ML Model
Train your quote prediction model in Python using libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, then serialize it (pickle/joblib) for your backend API.

## Step 5: Build the React Frontend
Create a simple frontend with forms to collect inputs and display predictions from your backend API.

## Step 6: Deploy Your App
Once everything works locally, deploy your full-stack app.
- Deployment guide: [Deploying Flask + React App to Render](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/python-p4-deploying-flask-react-app-to-render)
- Backend deployment docs: [Render Flask Deployment Docs](https://render.com/docs/deploy-flask)

## Step 7: Add Advanced AI Features (Optional)
